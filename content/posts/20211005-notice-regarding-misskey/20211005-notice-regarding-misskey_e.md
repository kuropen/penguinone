Kuropen had account on Misskey.io and used it as main Fediverse account since September 16, 2021.

However, the account has been destroyed since Misskey.io system failure triggered by attacks on October 3, 2021.

Because of this, please be notified that I will use [an account on Gingadon](https://gingadon.com/@kuropen) as main account.
